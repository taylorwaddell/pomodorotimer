# Pomodoro Timer

### Purpose
Although the driving purpose of the creation of this app was to develop a more clear understanding of React, the actual app has quite a simple purpose. This project is a web adaptation of the commonly used and popular Pomodoro Timer productivity tool. The goal was to create an application that could be set once and then run continuously until stopped. With intervals of “focus” and “break” time. Featuring an alarm on every switch of timer type to alert the user of the change.

### Technologies and Tools
Technologies:
- React Library
- Bootstrap/CSS
Tools:
- VSCode
- GitHub
We decided to use the React Library for this project because of its unique ability to partially render a page without needing to reload. This was important in this project due to the nature of the timer needing to change and re-render periodically without user initiation.
We also found it helpful to utilize Bootstrap CSS Framework which allowed us to focus more on the development of the functionality of the app over the stylization. Without sacrificing style of course.
VSCode and GitHub are simply the leaders in the industry in their respective categories. We like the best, so these are the tools we used.

### How to use:
To use this application, simply set a break time and a focus time and hit play! The timer will automatically run through the focus time, alert you with and alarm, and then start the break timer. This process will continue until you press stop!

### Discoveries Made
This project taught me so much. Including, but not limited to:
1. How to utilize state across multiple components.
2. How to eliminate the chance for race conditions.
3. How to correctly utilize props and the downward flow of information as it relates to React.
4. Proper utilization of a Bootstrap progress bar.
Overall a very fun challenge that lead me to many fun discoveries and lots of fun puzzles & problems!

Thanks for checking out my app!
