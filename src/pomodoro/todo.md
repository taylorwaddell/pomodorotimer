# ToDo:
- fix progress bar
- disabled buttons (stop, timechangers)


## Done:
+ turn converter into function isntead of component so it can be called anywhere w argument instead of passing props
+ stop button should work
    + stops and resets break time and focus time
    + is disabled if timer isn't running or if timer is paused
+ fix break time and focus time adjusters
    + focus time buttons should work
    + break time buttons should work
    + preferably DRY
    + use converter function to display correct time
    + disable adjustments when timer is running
+ disable time change buttons when timer is running\
+ figure out how to track whether play has been hit yet
+ should go straight into break time when focus time is over
+ alarm should sound at end of sessions
+ infinite loop
+ time changers should effect timer time
